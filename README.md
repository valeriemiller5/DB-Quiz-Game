# DB-Quiz-Game

> Timed quiz covering questions related to Dragon Ball.  Click the *Start* button to begin the quiz, then answer the questions when prompted.  To check out the high scores, click the *High Scores* link at the top of the page.  Built with HTML, JavaScript, and Materialize CDN for CSS styling.

> Please Note: this app utilizes local storage to save the scores for the *High Scores* page.  For now, it will grab all key/value pairs that are in the local storage for all of my repositories deployed to github.io, so the data saved to the local storage from other deployed apps may appear here.  A fix is in the process to ensure that only the local storage items for this app will be rendered.
